- rdrand not working
- rtc_get_timestamp would be useful
- is_any_key_pressed would be useful
- screenVec2 requires unpacking and repacking for any math operation other than checking equality, which gets really messy because of the sheer amount of registers that end up being used
- the vec variant for draw_square doesn't seem to work??? (when i unpack them to pass the fields as argument of draw_square, it works, but when passing the vec directly, it draws nothing) - fixed
- the screenvec2 tile to screen function didn't work for some reason, applied my own fix, but that was still an issue
